            <h1>ASP 1.0</h1>
            <p>Released in December 1996</p>

            <h1>ASP 2.0</h1>
            <p>
                Released in December September 1997. ASP 2.0 provides six
                built-in objects: Application, ASPError, Request, Response,
                Server, and Session. A Session object, for example, represents a
                session that maintains the state of variables from page to page.
                The Active Scripting engine's support of the Component Object
                Model enables ASP websites to access functionality in compiled
                libraries such as dynamic-link libraries
            </p>

            <h1>ASP 3.0</h1>
            <p>
                Released in December November 2000. ASP 3.0 does not differ
                greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional
                enhancements such as Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute
                method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enables
                buffering by default and optimized the engine for better
                performance. ASP was supported until 14 January 2020 on Windows
                7. The use of ASP pages will be supported on Windows 8 for a
                minimum of 10 years from the Windows 8 release date. ASP is
                supported in all available versions of IIS as of 2025.
